# Ethereum Listing Service (ELS)


Introduction  
  
The Ethereum Listing Service (ELS) is a decentralized, transparent, and permissionless information listing protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain.   
  
ELS aims to revolutionize the way individuals and businesses post, discover, and share various types of information by leveraging the power of Web3 technology. ELS addresses the issues of information opacity, low trust, and classification confusion in the current market by creating a transparent, secure, and efficient information management system within the Ethereum ecosystem.


## Core Principles and Objectives
* Building a secure, transparent, and permissionless Ethereum ecosystem for the Web3
* Facilitating economic and social interaction by enabling individuals and businesses to freely post, discover, and share various types of information
* Ensuring data security, reliability, and immutability with decentralized smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain


## Key Features
* Decentralized Listings: ELS offers a protocol for users to post and discover a wide range of information and services without any intermediaries or central authorities.
* Information Freedom: ELS fosters an open ecosystem where users can freely share and access information, promoting economic and social interaction.
* Efficient Information Retrieval: ELS is based on the ERC-6150 standard and utilizes a B+ tree classification structure for efficient on-chain information retrieval.
* Identity Verification: ELS employs zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable secure and privacy-preserving identity verification for users and retailers, enhancing trust within the platform.
* DAO Governance: ELS is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that ensures democratic decision-making and active community engagement. ZKPs are utilized to guarantee the immutability of voting results.

## DAO Governance
* Decentralization: The governance model empowers the community to participate in the decision-making process and contribute to the protocol's development.

* Transparency: Proposals and voting results are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency in the governance process.

* Community Voting: ELS DAO members vote on proposals, expressing their support or opposition to the proposed changes.

* Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Voting results are processed through a zk-verifier, which generates zero-knowledge proofs to ensure verifiability and accuracy of the results.

* On-chain Verification: The zk-verifier verifies the zero-knowledge proofs on-chain, ensuring the authenticity and accuracy of the voting results.

* Governance State Update: Based on the verified voting results, the ELS DAO's governance state is updated accordingly.

* Proposal Execution: If a proposal receives enough support, the proposed changes are executed and take effect.
